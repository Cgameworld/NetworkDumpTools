/// Scale is performed on the GPU using RTT, so it's blazing fast.
/// Setting up and Getting back the texture data is the bottleneck.
/// But Scaling itself costs only 1 draw call and 1 RTT State setup!
/// WARNING: This script override the RTT Setup! (It sets a RTT!)        
///
/// Note: This scaler does NOT support aspect ratio based scaling. You will have to do it yourself!
/// It supports Alpha, but you will have to divide by alpha in your shaders,
/// because of premultiplied alpha effect. Or you should use blend modes.
