This mod allows for the easy dumping of roads inside the Cities: Skylines Road Editor.

Files this tool dumps:

_d.png\
_a.png\
_p.png\
_r.png\
.obj\
_lod.obj

Use:
1) Open up the road editor and select a road to edit
2) Press the control and comma keys (ctrl+,) together to run the tool inside the asset editor
3) If successful, the road files are dumped in the Cities_Skylines\Addons\Import folder

Even includes flipping!

Problem: Road selection doesn't refresh on keyboard shortcut or action
